# reddit-proxy

Basic flask server for grabbing reddit videos and embedding them on discord. Because nobody wants to open the whole reddit website just for one video.

## How to use?

Add the reddit post link to the base ```https://r.pouekdev.one/```

Like this: ```https://r.pouekdev.one/https://www.reddit.com/r/Awww/comments/1ds6uun/sleepexe/```

And send it on discord.

### And there you go!
